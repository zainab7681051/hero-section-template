            <p>
            <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue.js</a> (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view") is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.
            </p>
            <p>
            Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only. Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.

          <h2>Svelte</h2>
          <div class="abstract">
          <a href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank">Svelte</a> is a free and open-source front end component framework or language created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members. Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML templates to specialized code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance. 
          </p>
          <p>Application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on is modified.
